## Overriding `jms/serializer`
```bash
composer require "jms-serializer/serializer"
```

## Notice for @schmittjoh
I hate to fork the library instead of getting the original up to speed.

In a perfect world, I'd like to move the original repository to an organization, add a few contributors and work through all of the issues / PR's.

It mustn't be that the most popular serializing library for PHP is unmaintained.
